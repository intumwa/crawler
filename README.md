Here are possible things to change in the future, as did change between 2022 and 2024.

- MySQL version in `./docker-compose.yml`
- Playwright version in `./Dockerfile` and `./package.json`
- Depending on the host PC/server, the number of containers that run in parallel may change in ./run.sh

Other than that, I've added `./db.sql` script that is run upon `docker compose --build` and contains the database (MySQL) structure + 100 domain names to crawl. The DB structure can be changed aside before running Docker, especially concerning which or how many domain names to crawl.

I've found the following handy as I was cleaning and running Docker (back and forth because I had forgotten a lot of details concerning environment/configs --- take this with a grain of salt, or don't):

```
docker compose down
docker builder prune
rm -rf ../crawl-files-exp1
rm -rf ../crawl-data-exp1
docker compose up --build
```
I hope this is enough for the next time I'll tinker with the repo ðŸ¥´
